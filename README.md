This repository is used for week 2 challenge of 10Academy. The instructions for this project can be found in the challenge document. The objective of this project is to determine if the creative ad designed by SmartAd had a better impact on brand awareness than a dummy ad.

To test this I have used three machine learning algorithms in this repository.

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. XGBoost
